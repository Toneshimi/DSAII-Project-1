Project 1: Hash Table with Vigenere Cipher
User's Manual 

Setup and Compilation

1. Download and unzip the submission from eLearning on a Linux box in
the multi-platform lab.

2. The submission includes:
    - main.cpp 
    - Vigener.hpp 
    - Vigenere.cpp 
    - HashTable.hpp
    - HashTable.cpp
    - Makefile
    - names.txt(input file)
    - Proj1UML.png 
    - UserManual.txt(this file)

3. Environment: This program has been tested in the multi-platform lab 
and will run there.

4. Compiling: This program uses a Makefile for compilation.
At the command line in Linux, type make. The program produces an excecutable
entitled test.

Running the Program: Be sure names.txt is in the same directory as the executable.
Issue the command ./test. No command line arguments are required. 

User Input: No user interaction is required.

Output: Output of the legal and illegal test cases will go to the console
and there will be two files generated. Output will be similar to this:

Generated files: 
    - rawdata.txt (UserIDs and unencrypted passwords)
    - encrypteddata.txt (UserIDs and Vigenere encrypted passwords)
These files will be created in the same directory as the executable.

Passwords generated and saved to rawdata.txt
Passwords encrypted and saved to encrypteddata.txt
Data inserted into hash table.
